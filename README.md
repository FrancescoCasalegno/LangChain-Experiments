# Langchain Experiments ðŸ¦œðŸ”—

This repo contains examples of using [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain)

These are the examples that are currently available:
- [LangChain_Prompt-Model-Parser](LangChain_Prompt-Model-Parser.ipynb): This notebook shows how to use the LangChain library to create a flow for LLM involving the 3 standard components of **prompt** (typically with a **template prompt**), **model** (a LLM, typically some OpenAI model), and **parser** (typically to extract values from the response as a JSON file).
- **TODO** LangChain_Agent: This notebook shows how to use LangChain to combine the power of LLMs with third-party libraries ("agents") that can solve specific problems (e.g. calculator, Wolfram Alpha, ...) to create a more powerful AI models.
- **TODO** LangChain_Chains-QA: This notebook shows how to use LangChain to create a flow for QA using embeddings, vector databases, and a retriever-reader architecture for Question-Answering.
