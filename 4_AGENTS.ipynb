    "\n",
    "- People sometimes have unrealistic expectations for what a LLM can do.\n",
    "  - Complex arithmetic operations with numbers with many digits\n",
    "  - Solving more complex equations, integrals, differential equations\n",
    "  - Retrieving very specific information e.g. what is the 7th country in Africa by GDP?\n",
    "- But a more useful way to think of LLMs is to think of them as **reasoning engines**.\n",
    "- So they might use some background knowledge to which they were exposed at training time, but we shouldn't rely 100% on them.\n",
    "- On the other hand, for a variety of tasks there are great specific tools that we can use!\n",
    "- **Agents** combine LLMs with different tools that can be used to solve your tasks: internet browsers, symbolic engines, knowledge bases, etc.\n",
    "- LangChain comes with a huge list of Tools you can use to build your own Agents! Some examples:\n",
    "  - **Shell (bash)** — give access to a shell in a safe environment\n",
    "  - **Bing Search / DuckDuckGo Search / Google Search /** ... — Search the web using different search engines\n",
    "  - **ChatGPT Plugins** — use ChatGPT plugins to interact with the world\n",
    "  - **Dall-E Image Generator** — generate images from a prompt synthesized using an OpenAI LLM\n",
    "  - **PubMed** — Search the PubMed database for biomedical literature\n",
    "  - **Wikipedia** — Search Wikipedia for articles, media, and other contents\n",
    "  - **Wolfram Alpha** — Use Wolfram Alpha to solve equations, ... or access knowledge graph information\n",

      "Summary: The 2023 Spanish general election was held on Sunday, 23 July 2023, to elect the 15th Cortes Generales of the Kingdom of Spain. All 350 seats in the Congress of Deputies were up for election, as well as 208 of 265 seats in the Senate.\n",
      "The second government of Pedro Sánchez formed after the November 2019 Spanish general election consisted of a left-wing coalition between the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) and Unidas Podemos, the country's first such nationwide government since the times of the Second Spanish Republic. The government's tenure was quickly overshadowed by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, along with its political and economic consequences. These consequences included the COVID-19 recession resulting from the extensive COVID-19 lockdowns implemented to curb the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as the economic impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n",
      "On the right side of the political spectrum, the People's Party (PP) underwent a leadership change at the 20th National Congress of the PP in February 2022, following an internal push by Galician and Madrilenian presidents, Alberto Núñez Feijóo and Isabel Díaz Ayuso, to remove party leader Pablo Casado. Since Feijóo's accession, the PP led opinion polls and finished first in the regional and local elections of 28 May 2023. Far-right Vox has been open to support the PP in a hung parliament in exchange for government participation and programatic concessions. The liberal Citizens party, once a leading force but having lost most of its support since 2019, decided not to run in this election, focusing its efforts on the 2024 European Parliament election instead.Despite speculation about an early election, Pedro Sánchez, the incumbent prime minister of Spain, consistently expressed his intention to complete the legislature as scheduled in 2023. He had initially set a tentative election date for December 2023, near the conclusion of the Spanish presidency of the Council of the European Union. The poor results of the left-wing bloc in the May 2023 regional and local elections, with losses to the PP and Vox in all but three regions, led to a surprise early dissolution of Parliament in what was described as a gamble by Sánchez to wrong-foot the opposition.In the closest election since 1996, the PP saw the biggest increase in support and secured 137 seats in the Congress, but fell short of expectations which had placed it at around 150 to 160 seats. The PSOE placed second and overperformed polls by improving upon previous results, gaining almost 1 million votes and scoring its best result since 2008 in terms of votes and vote share. Vox saw a decrease in its popular vote and seats, while Sumar won 31 seats in the Congress, a decrease in the popular vote and seats of its constituent parties. Neither bloc achieved a majority and, despite losses among Catalan independence parties, the balance of power was held by the Together for Catalonia (Junts) party of former Catalan president and fugitive Carles Puigdemont. In the case a government is not formed, a repeat election is likely.\n",
